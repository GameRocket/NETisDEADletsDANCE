# NETisDEADletsDANCE

First person shooter with portals.

Project is moved to new repository.

## More about
Initially, the project was conceived as a requiem for the "UNet" multiplayer system, but later it was decided to continue its development in a private repository already under new multiplayer solution "NetCode".
In this project I create a set of scripts and prefabs for a project where there will be portals and first-person shooting. Here we have a 3D scene with walls, portals, some player script, some sort of shooting system with RayCast and simple menu for a game. Feel free to use any kind of this for your projects if you want.

## Unity version
Unity engine version 2022.2.0f1
